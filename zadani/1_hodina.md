### Warm up
What will the following code do? Answer to chat.
``` python
a = 2
b = 3
c = 5

print(str(a) + str(b) + str(c))
```

### Usefull functions with strings
- string is like array of letters: ``` "hello"[0] --> "h" ```
- slicing: ``` "hello"[1:3] --> "el" ```
- concatenation: ``` "a" + "b" --> "ab" ```
- split(deliminator) - splits string to parts separated by deliminator, returns them as array
``` python
string = "a,b,c,d"
parts = string.split(',')
# parts --> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```
