## **14.hodina - 4. 1. 2021**

*Look at the exercices, work together with your group to discuss and solve them. Try to come up with the solution by yourself, if you don't know, you can consult code from previouse lessons or the internet. If you are stuck, you can skip to the next task.*

#### Functions
- Remind yourselves what are functions and their syntax in python.
- What are parameters and return value (návratová hodnota)? How to call a function (volání funkce)?
- Write function sum that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns sum of all its elements. (returns, not prints! think about the difference)

#### Dictionary (slovník)
- What is a dictionary data structure and how it is written in python?
- Look into basic operations with a dictionary - accessing element with key, changing value for given key, adding new key-value pair...
- Remember how to loop through dictionary.
- Write a function that will take two lists as parameters - a list of first names and a list of surnames. The function will return a dictionary that has first names as keys and corresponding surnames as values. Eg. for lists \["Jane", "Edgar Allan", "Lev"\] and \["Austen", "Poe", "Tolstoy"\] it will return dictionary \{"Jane" : "Austen", "Edgar Allan" : "Poe", "Lev" : "Tolstoy" \}
- Think about what would happen if some of the names repeate.
- Imagine you have a list of all items in your fridge where some items can repeat eg. \["egg", "egg", "milk", "cheese", "egg", "cheese" \]. Write a function that will take that list and print quantities of all items like this (hint: use a dictionary):
  - egg: 3
  - milk: 1
  - cheese: 2
